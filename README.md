# Operators
## AIM
To understand the types and functions of different operators in C++
## THEORY
An operator in programming is a symbol or set of symbols, that designates a particular operation or action to be carried out on data. We can execute mathematical calculations, value comparisons, value assignments, and other operations by manipulating variables and values with operators.
- **Arithmetic Operators**
  <br>We use arithmetic operators in C++ to execute mathematical operations on numerical quantities. They let you carry out mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION |
  |:---------:|:-----------:|
  |     +     | Addition |
  | - | Subtraction |
  | * | Multiplication |
  | / | Division |
  | % | Modulus |
- **ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS**
  <br>Variables can have values assigned to them using assignment operators. They let you carry out an action and save a value in a variable or change its current value concurrently.
  | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION |
  |:---------:|:-----------:|
  |     =     | Simple Assignment |
  | += | Addition Assignment |
  | -= | Subtraction Assignment |
  | *= | Multiplication Assignment |
  | /= | Division Assignment |
  | %= | Modulo Assignment |
- **RELATIONAL OPERATORS**
  <br>In C++, relational operators are employed to assess the connection between two values by comparison. A boolean value of true or false is returned by these operators after they have evaluated the criteria.
  | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION |
  |:---------:|:-----------:|
  |     ==    | Equal To |
  | != | Not Equal To |
  | > | Greater Than |
  | < | Less Than |
  | >= | Greater Than or Equal To |
  | <= | Less Than or Equal To |
- **LOGICAL OPERATORS**
  <br>C++ logical operators are utilized when working with boolean values (true or false). These operators let you combine many conditions and determine the truth value of each one using a truth table. The three types of logical operators in C++ are logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT.
  | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION |
  |:---------:|:-----------:|
  |     &&    | Logical AND |
  | || | Logical OR |
  | ! | Logical NOT |
